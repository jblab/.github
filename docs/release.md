# Release

This workflows can be used to generate new releases with `semantic-release` based on conventional commits.

## Requirements

TODO confirm these

- **package.json**: with the packages required by `semantic-release`
- **package-lock.json**: not strictly required but highly recommended.
- **.nvmrc**: with the node version to use
- **.releaserc**: with the `semantic-release` configuration
